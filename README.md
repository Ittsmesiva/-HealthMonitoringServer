Health Monitoring Server 🏥💡
A real-time health monitoring system that collects, processes, and visualizes patient data using IoT and embedded systems. Designed for remote monitoring and predictive healthcare, this project helps track vital signs such as heart rate, temperature, and SpO2 in real-time.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time Data Collection – Captures patient vitals via ESP32 and biomedical sensors.
✅ Data Visualization – Displays health metrics through an interactive web dashboard.
✅ Wireless Communication – Uses Wi-Fi/MQTT for seamless data transmission.
✅ Cloud Integration – Stores and retrieves patient data securely. (Optional: Firebase, AWS, or a local database)
✅ AI & Predictive Analysis – Implements basic data analytics/machine learning for early anomaly detection. (If applicable)
